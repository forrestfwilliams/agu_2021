# Operationalizing InSAR and Pixel Offset Time Series Methodologies for Landslide Monitoring

This repository contains the Python code used to generate figures for my 2021 AGU presentation on detecting landslide movement using timeseries InSAR and pixel offset tracking. The data used to create the presentation can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/record/5768622#.YbN8C73MKUk). A Docker image that can run this notebook can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/forrestwilliams/gis). Alternatively, the `gis.yml` file in this directory can be used to create an Anaconda environment that can run the notebook.
